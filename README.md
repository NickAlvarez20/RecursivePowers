## Project Name
Recursive Powers
## About
This project implements a recursive power function in JavaScript, computing the result of raising a base number to an exponent. It handles positive and negative exponents, even and odd cases, and includes test assertions to verify correctness. The code demonstrates efficient recursion with optimized handling of even exponents.
## Prerequisites
To run this project you need JavaScript (Node.js or a browser environment) installed on your system. No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This RecursivePowers includes these features:

-Recursive calculation of exponentiation for positive and negative exponents

-Optimized handling of even exponents using square-and-multiply

-Helper functions to check for even and odd numbers

-Test assertions to verify correctness for various inputs

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: 

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/RecursivePowers.git`
## Usage
Run the JavaScript script (calcPowerUseRecursion.js) from the command line using Node.js: 

node `calcPowerUseRecursion.js`

Alternatively, include the script in an HTML file and open it in a browser to see console output.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master recursive function design and optimization in JavaScript

-Handle edge cases like negative exponents and zero

-Implement and verify mathematical computations with test assertions

-Understand efficient algorithms like square-and-multiply for exponentiation
